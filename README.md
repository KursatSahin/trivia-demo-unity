To run the project, you will need to use Unity version 2021.3.1f1. According to the case study, the project communicates with a local server by making API calls. To simulate this, I set up an environment using the Mockoon app, which you can use as a local server. 

You can find the settings file for the environment that includes following endpoints on the release page 

- http://localhost:8080/leaderboard?page=0
- http://localhost:8080/leaderboard?page=1
- http://localhost:8080/questions

Since this project relies on a local server, it is not possible to run it as an apk, but you can test it on any pc.
